# dave-quotes:

## A small Python TUI application to display a random Dave Strider quote.
Made possible thanks to [Brad Greco's Homestuck quote database](https://www.bgreco.net/hsquote/0)

## Usage:
Run dave.py from your terminal. Make sure the file is marked as executable, and that you have the file 'dave-quotes.csv' inside the data folder. Use the arrow keys to change options and Enter to select one.

## Bugs:
* When resizing the terminal, sometimes the words will get cut off. There's no word wrapping. At least it shouldn't crash.
* It WILL CRASH when resizing vertically. I'll fix it later.
